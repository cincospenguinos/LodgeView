# LodgeView

Web service to manage a lodge. Basically it's kind of obnoxious to deal with having people take on new officers positions and 
all of the stuff that was used by so-and-so is gone because he's off with the SRICF or what have you, so I'm making this
to hopefully solve that problem.

## Features

- [ ] Lodge information webpage--both public facing and private facing
- [ ] CRUD current officers, offering various privileges to officer positions, not user accounts
- [ ] CRUD various files and things
- [ ] Hold calendar of events and things
- [ ] Submit mass emails for each week/month/whenever for different events or whenever a brother wants to submit it
- [ ] Contact list for different services/offers for help
- [ ] Submit messages automagically to other applications (Slack, Group Spaces, etc.)
- [ ] Keep track of who's paying dues
- [ ] Allow users to pay dues through the application
- [ ] Keep track of potential candidates and assign users to investigation committees
- [ ] Keep track of candidate's progress and time left for them to complete

The only thing I would want to do is check and see if this is acceptable to do.
